# 1. Track hub definition
# 2. File location and settings
# 3. Grouping tracks into sets and hierarchies: 
#    - superTrack container: when the tracks share no specific configuration and you mostly want to show them together
#    - composite container: when the tracks are expected to be configured together or have an internal subgrouping. TODO
#    - multiWig container: when the tracks are all in signal format and it makes sense to overlay them TODO
